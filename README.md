# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis with Power BI

This project is an exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset using **Power BI** to investigate which features might have influenced passenger survival.  

It explores several key questions such as:
- Did female had higher survival rate than male?
- How strong was the influence of gender and age?
- Was passenger class a form of privilege?

> 🔍 Bonus: Speculative insights based on fare anomalies and potential shared tickets were also explored.

## 📊 Project Contents

- **chapter2 titanic data analysis.pbix** — Power BI file containing all dashboards, charts, and analysis logic.
- **chapter2 titanic data analysis.pdf** — Power BI visualization in pdf format.
- **EmbarkationPoint.xlsx** — File latitude and longitude of embarkation points.

## 📁 Dataset Source

This project uses the Titanic dataset from the [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) competition.
This project also uses **Box and Whisker (Pro).pbiviz** from [Power BI Visuals App Source](https://github.com/DataChant/PowerBI-Visuals-AppSource/tree/main/All%20Visuals/PBIVIZ).

> 📌 **Note**: The pbviz file and actual dataset (`train.csv` / `train.xlsx`) is **not included** in this repository due to license and storage considerations.  
If you want to explore the `.pbix` file fully, please download the dataset manually from the links and load it via Power BI.

## 🧠 Highlights of Analysis

- Boxplots of ticket fare by class and embarkation point
- Survival rate comparison by class, gender, age group, and ticket price per person
- Humanized narrative and assumption-driven storytelling
- Reflections on missing values, ticket sharing, and unrecorded factors

## 🌐 Future Work

In the next move, I plan to:
- Web scrape additional data to fill missing values (using BeautifulSoup)
- Data manipulation using Pandas
- Apply machine learning model prediction (Titanic ML 2.0 version)
